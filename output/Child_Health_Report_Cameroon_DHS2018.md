## Executive Summary

This report presents a comprehensive analysis of child health indicators in Cameroon based on the 2018 Demographic and Health Survey (DHS). The analysis focuses on childhood morbidity (diarrhea, fever, and acute respiratory infections), treatment-seeking behaviors, and feeding practices during illness.

### Key Findings

| Indicator | Prevalence | Treatment Seeking |
|-----------|------------|-------------------|
| Diarrhea | 11.9% | 51.6% |
| Fever | 15.4% | 61.0% |
| ARI Symptoms | 1.0% | 59.2% |

- **Fever:** 15.4% - the most common childhood illness
- **Diarrhea:** 11.9% - affecting approximately 1 in 8 children
- **ARI Symptoms:** 1.0% - relatively rare but potentially severe

## 3. Socio-Economic Determinants

### 3.1 ORS Use by Wealth Quintile

Access to ORS treatment shows a clear wealth gradient:

| Wealth Quintile | ORS Rate |
|-----------------|----------|
| Poorest | 9.2% |
| Poorer | 12.5% |
| Middle | 19.3% |
| Richer | 21.8% |
| Richest | 29.9% |

### 3.2 Care-Seeking by Mother's Education

| Education Level | Care-Seeking Rate |
|-----------------|-------------------|
| No Education | 51.1% |
| Primary | 63.7% |
| Secondary | 65.6% |
| Higher | 63.9% |

## 4. Feeding Practices During Illness

### 4.1 Fluid and Food Intake During Diarrhea

WHO recommends increasing fluids and maintaining food intake during diarrhea:

**Liquids given:**
- More: 32.3%
- Same: 30.1%
- Less: 25.2%
- None: 2.5%

**Food given:**
- More: 10.3%
- Same: 33.7%
- Less: 39.6%
- None: 3.9%

## 6. Conclusions and Recommendations

### Key Findings:
1. **Fever** is the most prevalent childhood illness (15.4%)
2. **Diarrhea** peaks in children aged 6-23 months (21.1%)
3. **ORS treatment** shows significant wealth disparities (9.2% poorest vs 29.9% richest)
4. **Combined ORS+Zinc** use remains low at 7.7%

### Recommendations:
1. Target diarrhea prevention for 6-23 month age group
2. Improve ORS access in poorest wealth quintiles
3. Promote combined ORS+Zinc treatment
4. Educate caregivers on feeding practices during illness
