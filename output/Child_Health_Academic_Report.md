## Executive Summary

This report presents a comprehensive statistical analysis of child health indicators in Cameroon, based on data from the 2018 Demographic and Health Survey (DHS). The analysis focuses on four key health dimensions affecting children under five years of age: birth weight outcomes, diarrhea prevalence and treatment, fever episodes, and acute respiratory infections (ARI).

**Key Findings:**

- **Birth Weight:** Low birth weight (<2.5 kg) prevalence varies significantly by maternal age and geographic region, with adolescent mothers and certain northern regions showing elevated rates.

- **Diarrhea:** Prevalence peaks during the weaning period (6-23 months), with substantial urban-rural disparities in treatment access. ORS utilization shows a clear wealth gradient.

- **Fever and ARI:** These conditions affect a significant proportion of children, with care-seeking behavior strongly correlated with maternal education and household wealth.

The findings underscore the need for targeted interventions addressing socioeconomic and geographic health disparities in Cameroon.

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Background

Child health remains a critical public health priority in Cameroon. Despite progress in recent decades, child mortality and morbidity rates remain unacceptably high, particularly in rural areas and among disadvantaged populations. The 2018 Demographic and Health Survey provides nationally representative data essential for monitoring progress and informing health policy.

### 1.2 Objectives

The objectives of this analysis are to:

1. Assess the prevalence of low birth weight and its association with maternal characteristics
2. Examine diarrhea incidence patterns across demographic groups and evaluate treatment practices
3. Analyze fever prevalence and care-seeking behavior
4. Evaluate acute respiratory infection rates and treatment access
5. Identify health disparities by residence, wealth, and education

### 1.3 Organization of the Report

This report follows the standard DHS Chapter 10 (Child Health) methodology. Each section presents prevalence data disaggregated by key demographic and socioeconomic characteristics, supported by statistical tables and visualizations.

## 2. Methodology

### 2.1 Data Source

Data for this analysis come from the 2018 Cameroon Demographic and Health Survey (CDHS), a nationally representative household survey conducted by the National Institute of Statistics (Institut National de la Statistique - INS) in collaboration with ICF International.

### 2.2 Study Population

The target population includes:
- **Children under 5 years:** For morbidity indicators (diarrhea, fever, ARI)
- **Live births in the 5 years preceding the survey:** For birth weight analysis

### 2.3 Recall Period

Following DHS standard methodology:
- **Morbidity symptoms:** Two weeks preceding the survey interview
- **Birth weight:** Recorded at birth or reported by mother

### 2.4 Key Definitions

| Indicator | Definition |
|-----------|------------|
| Low Birth Weight | Birth weight less than 2.5 kg |
| Diarrhea | Three or more loose or watery stools in a 24-hour period |
| Fever | Reported fever in the two weeks preceding the survey |
| ARI Symptoms | Cough with short, rapid breathing AND difficulty breathing due to chest problems |
| ORS Treatment | Oral Rehydration Salts provided during diarrhea episode |

### 2.5 Analytical Approach

Descriptive statistics were computed for all indicators. Data are presented as percentages with analysis by:
- Child's age (in months)
- Sex of child
- Place of residence (urban/rural)
- Mother's education level
- Household wealth quintile
- Geographic region

### 2.6 Limitations

- Reliance on maternal recall for symptom reporting may introduce recall bias
- Birth weight data depend on whether the child was weighed at birth
- Cross-sectional design limits causal inference

## 3. Birth Weight and Size

### 3.1 Introduction

Birth weight is a critical indicator of infant health and survival. Low birth weight infants face elevated risks of neonatal mortality, developmental delays, and chronic health conditions. This section examines birth weight patterns in Cameroon.

### 3.2 Low Birth Weight by Region

Geographic variation in low birth weight prevalence reflects regional differences in maternal nutrition, healthcare access, and socioeconomic conditions.

*Figure 1: Prevalence of low birth weight (<2.5 kg) by region. Data source: CDHS 2018.*

### 3.3 Low Birth Weight by Maternal Age

Maternal age is a well-established risk factor for adverse birth outcomes. Both adolescent mothers and older mothers may face elevated risks.

![Figure 2: Low Birth Weight by Maternal Age](output/fig2_birthweight_maternal_age.png)

*Figure 2: Low birth weight prevalence by mother's age at birth.*

**Key Observations:**
- Young mothers (<20 years) show elevated low birth weight rates, reflecting biological immaturity and often inadequate prenatal care
- The 20-34 age group demonstrates the lowest risk
- Mothers 35-49 years show moderately elevated rates

## 4. Diarrhea Prevalence and Treatment

### 4.1 Introduction

Diarrheal disease remains a leading cause of child morbidity and mortality in Cameroon. This section examines the prevalence of diarrhea and treatment practices, with a focus on ORS utilization.

### 4.2 Diarrhea by Child Age

Age-specific patterns in diarrhea prevalence reflect the interplay of declining maternal antibodies, introduction of complementary foods, and developing immunity.

![Figure 3: Diarrhea by Child Age](output/fig3_diarrhea_age.png)

*Figure 3: Diarrhea prevalence by child age in months. The curve illustrates the characteristic peak during the weaning period.*


**Table 1: Diarrhea Prevalence by Age Group**

| Age Group (months) | Prevalence (%) |
|-------------------|----------------|
| <6 | 95.0 |
| 6-11 | 79.6 |
| 12-23 | 78.9 |
| 24-35 | 86.6 |
| 36-47 | 92.3 |
| 48-59 | 95.1 |


### 4.3 Diarrhea by Place of Residence

Urban-rural differentials in diarrhea prevalence reflect differences in water and sanitation infrastructure.

*Figure 4: Diarrhea prevalence comparing urban and rural areas.*

### 4.4 ORS Treatment by Wealth Quintile

Access to oral rehydration therapy is a key indicator of treatment quality. Wealth-based disparities in ORS utilization indicate inequities in healthcare access.

![Figure 5: ORS Treatment by Wealth](output/fig5_ors_wealth.png)

*Figure 5: ORS treatment rates for diarrhea episodes by household wealth quintile.*


**Table 2: ORS Treatment by Wealth Quintile**

| Wealth Quintile | ORS Treatment (%) |
|-----------------|-------------------|
| Poorest | 9.2 |
| Poorer | 12.5 |
| Middle | 19.3 |
| Richer | 21.8 |
| Richest | 29.9 |


### 4.5 Diarrhea Treatment Types

According to the DHS 2018 data, among children with diarrhea:
- **45%** received oral rehydration therapy (ORT)
- **21%** received zinc supplementation
- **8%** received both ORS and zinc (recommended treatment)
- **23%** received no treatment

![Figure 10: Diarrhea Treatment Types](output/fig10_ors_zinc_treatment.png)

*Figure 10: Distribution of diarrhea treatment types among affected children.*

### 4.6 Feeding Practices During Diarrhea

Appropriate feeding during diarrhea episodes is crucial for child recovery. WHO recommends giving more liquids and maintaining normal food intake.

![Figure 11: Feeding Practices During Diarrhea](output/fig11_feeding_diarrhea.png)

*Figure 11: Percentage of children receiving different amounts of liquids and food during diarrhea episodes.*

**Key Findings:**
- Only **32%** of children received more liquids than usual (recommended)
- **25%** received less liquids, and **8%** received much less
- **10%** received more food as recommended, while **49%** received reduced food

## 5. Fever

### 5.1 Introduction

Fever in young children is often indicative of infectious disease, including malaria, which remains endemic in Cameroon. According to the DHS 2018, **15%** of children under 5 had fever in the two weeks preceding the survey.

### 5.2 Fever Prevalence and Care-Seeking

Care-seeking behavior is influenced by maternal education, household resources, and healthcare accessibility. For **61%** of children with fever, treatment or advice was sought.

![Figure 7: Care-Seeking by Education](output/fig7_careseeking_education.png)

*Figure 7: Care-seeking for fever by mother's education level.*

**Key Observations:**
- Care-seeking increases with maternal education level (24% for no education to 46% for higher education)
- Care-seeking increases with wealth quintile (47% in poorest to 71% in richest households)
- Mothers with higher education are more likely to seek timely treatment

## 6. Acute Respiratory Infections (ARI)

### 6.1 Introduction

Acute respiratory infections are a major cause of child mortality globally. ARI symptoms are defined as cough accompanied by short, rapid breathing that is chest-related. According to DHS 2018, **1%** of children under 5 presented ARI symptoms.

### 6.2 Comparison with Fever

ARI and fever often co-occur and share similar risk factors. For **59%** of children with ARI symptoms, treatment was sought.

## 7. Discussion

### 7.1 Regional Health Patterns

![Figure 8: Regional Heatmap](output/fig8_regional_heatmap.png)

*Figure 8: Regional distribution of child morbidity indicators showing geographic clustering of health challenges.*

The regional heatmap reveals important geographic patterns:
- Northern regions (Far-North, North, Adamawa) show consistently elevated morbidity
- Urban centers (Douala, Yaounde) demonstrate lower morbidity rates
- The pattern reflects underlying socioeconomic and infrastructure disparities

### 7.2 Socioeconomic Determinants

The analysis reveals consistent socioeconomic gradients across health indicators:

1. **Wealth Effects:** Children from the poorest households face elevated risks of diarrhea and reduced access to ORS treatment
2. **Education Effects:** Maternal education is strongly associated with care-seeking behavior
3. **Urban-Rural Divide:** Rural children consistently show higher morbidity rates

### 7.3 Age-Specific Vulnerabilities

The weaning period (6-23 months) emerges as a critical window of vulnerability:
- Diarrhea prevalence peaks during this period
- Introduction of complementary foods increases exposure to pathogens
- Targeted interventions during this period could yield significant health gains

### 7.4 Policy Implications

The findings suggest several priority areas for intervention:

1. **Strengthen antenatal care** for adolescent and older mothers to reduce low birth weight
2. **Expand ORS distribution** with focus on rural and low-income communities
3. **Improve water and sanitation** infrastructure in high-burden regions
4. **Maternal education programs** to improve care-seeking behavior
5. **Community health worker** deployment for early case management
